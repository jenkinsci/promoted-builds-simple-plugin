<div>
	Promoting a build marks it "Keep Forever," which means it cannot be removed
	by the normal housekeeping configured under "Discard Old Builds."<br/><br/>
	This "Clean up" functionality allows you to set policies about when promoted
	builds will be un-marked "Keep Forever."
	<p>
		Each policy consists of a "trigger level", a "target level", and a count.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ex.<br/>
		To make "QA Build" runs delete-able after three newer builds have been
		promoted to "QA Build," then: target level=QA Build, count=3,  trigger level=QA Build<br/>
		To make "QA Build" runs delete-able once a single newer build has been
		promoted to "GA Release," then:  target level=QA Build, count=1, trigger level=GA Release<br/>

	</p>
